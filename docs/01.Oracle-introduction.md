## Oracle Database:

Oracle Database, also known as Oracle DB or Oracle Relational Database Management System (RDBMS), is a system that stores, organizes, and retrieves data by type while maintaining relationships between all the various types of data.


Oracle Converged (‡¶è‡¶ï‡¶§‡ßç‡¶∞‡¶ø‡¶§/‡¶Ö‡¶≠‡¶ø‡¶®‡ßç‡¶®) database engine. ‚ÄúConverged‚Äù means combined or unified ‚Äî Oracle's engine brings together multiple database features that traditionally required separate databases or engines.

Oracle Converged Database Engine is a unified platform that supports multiple data models like relational, JSON, spatial, graph, and more ‚Äî all within a single database. It reduces complexity by eliminating the need for multiple specialized databases.


### Core Components:
- **Oracle Instance** : Set of background processes + memory structures used to manage database files.
- **Oracle Database** : Set of physical files that store data.
- **Schemas** : Logical collections of database objects (tables, views, indexes, etc.).
- **Tablespaces** : Logical storage units in Oracle.
- **Redo Logs** : Record changes for recovery.
- **Datafiles** : Physical files that store actual data.


### Key Features:
- **High Availability** : Oracle Real Application Clusters (RAC), Data Guard.
- **Security** : Fine-grained access control, Transparent Data Encryption (TDE).
- **Performance** : Advanced indexing, in-memory computing, partitioning.
- **Backup and Recovery** : RMAN (Recovery Manager), flashback technology.
- **Multitenant Architecture** : Pluggable Databases (PDBs) in a Container Database (CDB).
- **Advanced Analytics** : Machine learning, spatial, graph, JSON, etc.

### History of Oracle:

Highlights in the evolution of Oracle Database include the following:

#### Founding of Oracle:
In 1977, **Larry Ellison**, **Bob Miner**, and **Ed Oates** started the consultancy **Software Development Laboratories (SDL)**, which became Relational Software, Inc. (RSI). In 1983, RSI became Oracle Systems Corporation and then later **Oracle Corporation**.


#### First commercially available RDBMS:
In 1979, RSI introduced **Oracle V2** (Version 2) as the first commercially available SQL-based RDBMS, a landmark event in the history of relational databases.


#### Portable version of Oracle Database:
**Oracle V3** (Version 3), released in 1983, was the first relational database to run on mainframes, minicomputers, and PCs. The database was written in C, enabling the database to be ported to multiple platforms (cross-platform).


#### Enhancements to concurrency control, data distribution, and scalability:
Version 4 introduced multiversion **read consistency**. Version 5, released in 1985, supported client/server computing and **distributed database** systems. Version 6 brought enhancements to disk I/O, row locking, scalability, and backup and recovery. Also, Version 6 introduced the first version of the **PL/SQL** language, a proprietary procedural extension to SQL.


#### PL/SQL stored program units: 
Oracle7, released in 1992, introduced PL/SQL stored procedures and triggers.

- Oracle7: It is a stanalone rdbms, it is not support online processing. 
- Stored procedures
- Triggers
- Enhanced concurrency

#### Objects and partitioning: 
Oracle8 was released in 1997 as the object-relational database, supporting many new data types. Additionally, Oracle8 supported partitioning of large tables.
- Oracle8: It is a standalone rdbms and it is having indexes.
- Object-Relational features
- Large Object (LOB) support


#### Internet computing:
Oracle8i Database, released in 1999, provided native support for internet protocols and server-side support for Java. Oracle8i was designed for internet computing, enabling the database to be deployed in a multitier environment.

Oracle8i:
- 'i' = Internet
- It supports online data processing. 
- Introduced Java integration, XML support
- Support for web-enabled applications



#### Oracle Real Application Clusters (Oracle RAC):
Oracle9i Database introduced Oracle RAC in 2001, enabling multiple instances to access a single database simultaneously. Additionally, Oracle XML Database (Oracle XML DB) introduced the ability to store and query XML.

Oracle9i:
- It supports online data processing
- It also supporting internet applications. 
- Real Application Clusters (RAC)
- XML DB
- Flashback Queries


#### Grid computing: 
Oracle Database 10g introduced grid computing in 2003. This release enabled organizations to virtualize computing resources by building a grid infrastructure based on low-cost commodity servers. A key goal was to make the database self-managing and self-tuning. Oracle Automatic Storage Management (Oracle ASM) helped achieve this goal by virtualizing and simplifying database storage management.

- Oracle-10g: - Grid database (OLTP)
- 'g' = Grid Computing
- ASM (Automatic Storage Management)
- Data Pump introduced


#### Manageability, diagnosability, and availability:

Oracle Database 11g, released in 2007, introduced a host of new features that enabled administrators and developers to adapt quickly to changing business requirements. The key to adaptability is simplifying the information infrastructure by consolidating information and using automation wherever possible.


Oracle11g:
- Enhanced automation (e.g., SQL Replay)
- Real Application Testing
- Advanced compression and diagnostics


Oracle-11g: - Grid database (OLTP + OLAP)
- OLTP: On Line Transaction Processing 
	- It conatains Transactional data/day to day data/current data/dynamic data
	- it is used to store or process the business data.
		
- OLAP: On Line Analytical Processing 
	- it conatain historical data /old data
	- it is used to analyze the business


#### Plugging In to the Cloud: 
Oracle Database 12c, released in 2013, was designed for the Cloud, featuring a new Multitenant architecture, In-Memory column store, and support for JSON documents.


- Oracle12c:
    - 'c' = Cloud
    - Multitenant architecture (CDB and PDB)
    - In-memory options and JSON support


- Oracle18c / 19c (2018/2019):
    - Oracle-18c/19c: Autonomous Cloud database
    - Autonomous database concept begins
    - Self-driving, self-securing, and self-repairing DB
